# Sustainable-Aquatic-Cleaner-Boat
This repository contains the code and documentation for a prototype boat designed to clean light trash on stable aquatic surfaces. Controlled via a Bluetooth application and powered by a solar panel, this project aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by promoting environmental sustainability and clean water ecosystems.
